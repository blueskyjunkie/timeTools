Python utilities relating to synchronization analysis and visualization.

Dependencies:

* Python 3.4 (Python 2.7 may work but has not been tested)

It is highly recommended to use the [Anaconda distribution of Python](http://continuum.io/downloads "Anaconda distribution of Python") because to date all the necessary dependencies are included in the distribution. No additional installation necessary.
